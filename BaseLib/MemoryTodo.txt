What is Missing
---------------
.  GameObject and GameInstance.
.  Find GraphicsObject by name.
.  Programmatic way of instancing GraphicsObjects.
.  Does every MeshInstance/Object correspond to a Graphics one?
.  Behaviour and it's link to animation.
.  Converters don't belong in World.
.  Portals.
.  Physics.
.  Clone an instance rather than instance an object.

Nice to Have
------------
.  World must be rewritten!
.  Memory manager plugged into world.
.  Object database plugged into world.
.  Singleton and PersistenSingleton.
