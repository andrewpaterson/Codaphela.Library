What is Missing
---------------
*  GameObject and GameInstance. (Handled by Objects)
*  Find GraphicsObject by name. (Handled by Objects)
.  Programmatic way of instancing GraphicsObjects.
.  Does every MeshInstance/Object correspond to a Graphics one?
.  Behaviour and it's link to animation.
.  Converters don't belong in World.
.  Clone an instance rather than instance an object.
.  Portals.
.  Physics.

Nice to Have
------------
.  World must be rewritten!
.  Memory manager plugged into world.
.  Object database plugged into world.

Need to be turned into CObjects

Need to be removed

Conisder these folders (and classes)

NamedObjects must allow for nameless versions also.
