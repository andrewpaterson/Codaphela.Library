*Objects .GetNotInMemory does not try and load from sources.
*DependentReadObjects should not be aware of gcObjects.
*Make sure CObjects has a Close method that writes out all in memory objects.
*CBaseObject's mpcObjectsThisIn doesn't seem to be set always (after load?)
*ObjectAllocator must take over the Objects .Add functions.
*Hollow objects must be discared on dehollowfication, not remapped.
