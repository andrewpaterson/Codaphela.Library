DependentReadObjects should not be aware of gcObjects.
Make sure CObjects has a Close method that writes out all in memory objects.

CBaseObject's mpcObjectsThisIn doesn't seem to be set always (after load?)
ObjectAllocator must take over the Objects .Add functions.
ASCIITree needs to be split into two, one without Words.
Hollow objects must be discared on dehollowfication, not remapped.
Objects .GetNotInMemory does not try and load from sources.
